# Custom-GPS-Logger
This app was made by myself, Andre Unsal, and is covered by the MIT License. Any questions or inquiries may be directed to andreunsal@gmail.com, and I am also available at https://www.linkedin.com/in/andreunsal/.

## Intro
The app was made for iOS 12.1 with XCode version 10.1. The purpose of the app is to log GPS at a custom frequency (800 Hz) for data analytics in a university research project. The GPS coordinates are converted to cartesian coordinates in real-time by taking into account earth's radius, and the polar coordinate system.
